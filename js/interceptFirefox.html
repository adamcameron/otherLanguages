Hi:<br>
Sorry about the "WTF?" moment going on here. I am posting this notice in front of anyone accessing my blog from Firefox.<br><br>

As I say in my communications policy for this blog, everything here is my opinion. Generally I stick to my opinions about stuff relating to CFML, but I reserve the right to express my opinion on any topic.<br><br>

Something I have a strong opinion on is the topic of prejudice and bigotry. I won't conscion it. I do not simply mean racial bigotry, I mean bigotry of any stripe, including homophobia.<br><br>

I was very disappointed to see that Mozilla have appointed a "card-carrying" bigot to the position of CEO. As we have all heard by now, Brendan Eich is so prejudiced against homosexual people he has financially invested in attempts to underwrite homophobia into United States law.<br><br>

In my opinion, this is completely unacceptable. I can't have a say in whether he should be stood down from this position, but the longer he retains it, the dimmer is my view of Mozilla as a company.<br><br>

As my own small protest I have deinistalled Firefox from my computer, and I am also now inviting you to do the same.<br><br>

I'll only be displaying this banner to you once... I've popped a cookie on your browser so it should not display again. Sorry for the interruption.<br><br>

Cheers.<br><br>

Adam<br><br>
